This is a beginner-level web based project. Here we use Firebase Authentication to authenticate users. If the authenticated user is the administrator, then the administrator can add services, manage services, add administrators, manage orders, and simple users can provide reviews, book services and also see all the services they booked in advance.

Here we use MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs, Firebase authentication, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and javascript ES6 features.
